We will go through the statistical analysis behind [TriplotGUI]{style="color:orange"} and also explain the details of out data analysis and visulization in each step. If you want to search the meaning of something specific (e.g. a button, a box), please press `ctrl+F` and enter the keyword, you will probably find what you need.

If you have not open the app yet, follow what is written in the [Setup](installation.qmd){target="_blank" style="color:blue"} and open the interface with `TriplotGUI_shiny()`

::: {.alert .alert-primary}
**Note:** Later you can use the [example data](https://gitlab.com/YingxiaoYan/triplotgui/-/tree/main/Example_data?ref_type=heads){target="_blank"} in our repository to test the TriplotGUI interface yourself following [Tutorial(simple)](simple.qmd){target="_blank"}, [Tutorial(complex)](complex.qmd){target="_blank"} and [Use Case](use_case.qmd){target="_blank"}. This page is more like a mannual of the each detailed part of the tool

# **Step1:** Data reduction of Omics data

After reading the introduction (step 0), you can click step 1 at the side bar and you will see the lay out as below. ![](img/step1_1.png)

<br> As mentioned in the introduction, this step is to transform the Omics data into a number of components using principal component analysis (PCA) or weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA).

Five boxes with unique features are presented. You can more or less guess what they are for from there titles. Now we go through each boxes in details

## Data for PCA/WGCNA

### Basics {#Basics_1_1_1}

The [darkblue box]{style="color:darkblue"} is where you put in the Omics data. The data should meet the following criteria.

-   The data should be in either csv, xlsx, rds, or rda format. The data in rds format should be a dataframe. If the data is in rda format, the rda object should only contain the data as a dataframe and be in the same directory as your working directory (You could check this by `getwd()` in the R console)
-   The rows of data should represent observations and the columns of data should represents variables(omics features).
-   The names of variables (column names) should not contain special characters including `' '`, `'('`, `')'`, `':'`, `'/'`, `'-'`, `','`, `'@'`.
-   No missing values are allowed in the data
-   The number and order of observations should be same across all the uploaded data

::: callout-note
We do not provide the functionality of handling missing data or other data pre-processing steps (e.g. transformation, normalization) in our application due to the variability of possible methods.
:::

### Emerged {#Emerged_1_1_2}

After you upload the data, A text will show up to tell you how many rows and columns do you have in the data frame. Three following buttons also emerge: ***Inspect variable class, remove variables, Force all variables to numeric***.

1.  ***Inspect variable class*** This is a button that help you inspect if the variables are in correct format, since you may not want your metabolite features in character format when you want to use their numeric values. Click the button and explore.

2.  ***remove variables***: This button allows you to remove variables from your uploaded data. Click the button, remove some variables and click OK. What variables are removed are then printed out and they will not be included in the Omics data to enter the downstream analysis. We also make this removal reversible so that every time when you reclick this button, the data will go back to the state where no variables are removed.

    We add this button so that users will not need to manually remove redundant variables that will actually not be used in data analysis.

3.  ***Force all variables to numeric***: Upon clicking, this button simply forces all the variables to numeric. Since we want to perform PCA or WGCNA on this Omics data, we want all Omics variables to be in numeric format

### And more

At the right side of the upload data, there is a button called ***Reset everything***. This where you can click remove all your uploads and settings and make the interface go back to a default state.

## Auxilary data {#auxilary_data}

The [lightblue box]{style="color:lightblue"} is where you put in the auxilary data. Currently, the variables in the data uploaded here can be used for 2 things (1) Customizing the color, size and shape of scores. See section [1.4.2](#Emerged_1_4_2). (2) Providing pairing information for outcomes' associations. See section [1.1.1](#Basics_1_1_1).

### Basics {#Basics_1_2_1}

The requirement for input data is the same as [1.1.1](#Basics_1_1_1).

### Emerged {#Emerged_1_2_2}

After you upload the axuliary data, A text will show up to tell you how many rows and columns do you have in the data frame. Three following buttons also emerge: ***Inspect variable class, remove variables, Change variable class***.

1.  ***Inspect variable class*** Same as [1.1.2](#Emerged_1_1_2)

2.  ***remove variables***: Same as [1.1.2](#Emerged_1_1_2)

3.  ***Change variable class***: This button provide your choices in transforming variables to either factor and numeric variables.

    We add this button to faciliate user in tranforming variables to numeric and factor format, corresponding to numeric and caregorical variables.

## Data analysis settings

The [red box]{style="color:red"} is where you make choices in how do you want your data analysis to be performed

### Basics

1.  ***Method***: Users choose to either use principal component analysis (*PCA*) or weighted correlation network analysis (*WGCNA*) to perform data reduction. The default is *PCA*

2.  ***PCA function***: Users choose what PCA function, [*prcomp*](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/prcomp){target="_blank"} or [*principal*](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/psych/versions/2.4.1/topics/principal){target="_blank"}, will be used for principal component analysis. The default is *prcomp*

3.  ***Max number of components***: This button shows up when the ***Method*** is *PCA*. It decides how many principal component will be used in the downstream correlation& association analysis. The default is set as around the half of the total number of omics variables used for analysis.

    ***Minimum number for variables per module***: This button shows up when the ***Method*** is *WGCNA*. It decides the minimum number of variables that is allowed in each cluster of WGCNA. The default number is *2*.

4.  ***Center***: If the omics variables will be zero centered before the analysis take place. The default is *Yes*.

5.  ***Scale***: If the omics variables will be scaled to have unit variance before the analysis take place. The default is *Yes*.

### Emerged

1.  ***rotate***: The button will show up and When ***PCA function*** is chosen as *principal*. How users would like to transform principal components. Please check [*here*](https://search.r-project.org/CRAN/refmans/psych/html/fa.html){target="_blank"} for the explanation fo rotate. The default is set as *none* in TriplotGUI.

::: callout-note
You maybe heard about PCA but not **WGCNA**. In brief, WGCNA is to separate omics variables into clusters, perform PCA on each cluster and extract the first principal component of each cluster as the principal components of WGCNA. The clustering method can be different. In TriplotGUI, we use the default hierarchical clustering method provided by `cutreeDynamic()` in the *dunamicTreeCut* package
:::

## Visualization settings

The [orange box]{style="color:orange"} is where users can modify their visulization outputs

### Basics

1.  ***Which plots***: Four options are provided: (1) *scores*: The scores of principal components are plotted. (2)*loadings*: The loadings of principal components are plotted.

When choosing *Perform one-hot-encoding*, categorical variables with n classes(n\>2) are transformed to n binary variables with 0 and 1 values and then used as numeric variables. When chosing *Use original*, no transformation is made on the categorical variabls and linear models are used for categorical exposure-principal component correlation analysis. The default is *Use original*.

### Emerged

1.  ***Full or partial correaltion*** Upon uploading the [covariate data](#Covaraite_data1), the button will show up. Two options are provided: *Full* and *Partial*. *Full* means no covariates are used as confounders in the correlation analysis and *Partial* means that partial correlations, adjusting the same group of confounders, are performed on all exposures-principal components correlations.

## Visualizations

The [green box]{style="color:green"} represents visualization outputs. With omics data from step 1 and exposure data uploaded, upon clicking the ***Refresh plot*** button, the correlations between exposures and the 2 selected components (selected from step 1) are shown. The figure can be downloaded by clicking ***Download figure***.

# **Step2B:** Associations with outcomes.

After uploading Omics and auxilary data (optional) in step 1, you can click "Outcomes' associations" in step 2 at the side bar and you will see the lay out as below. ![](img/step2_2.png)

<br> This step is to calculate risk associations between the principal components from step 1 and outcomes uploaded at this step.

Five boxes with unique features are presented. Now we go through each boxes in details

::: callout-note
For outcomes - principal-components associations, statistical analysis are performed differently based on different classes of outcome and information provided. The table below summarized the methods and R packages used.

![](img/step2_3.png)
:::

### Basics

1.  ***log(risk estimates)***: Users can choose whether they want their risk estimations to be presented as beta coefficients or odds ratios. Two options are provided *Yes (useful for odds ratio)* and *No (useful for beta coefficient)*. The default is *No (useful for beta coefficient)*

### Emerged

1.  ***Do confounder adjustment***: Upon uploading the [covariate data](#Covaraite_data2), the button will show up. The users can choose if confounder will be adjusted for all outcomes-principal components associations, using the same group of confounders. The default is *No*.

2.  ***Multinomial***: If categorical variables with n\>2 class is uploaded or created from outcome variables, the button will show up. By selecting *No*, one-hot-encoding will be performed on these categorical variables to transform them to n binary variables with 0 and 1 values. By selecting *Yes*, multinomial regression will be performed on these categorical variables. The default is *No*

3.  ***Pairing variable*** When auxilary data [(1.2.1)](#auxilary_data) is uploaded, this button will show up. It allows users to select variables that contain pairing information in the auxilary data. For example, the matched case-control pair could constitute a categorical variable, where each pair of case and control is given a unique number. Such information can be fed in the modelling of outcome-principal components associations.

## Visualization settings

The [orange box]{style="color:orange"} is where users can modify their visulization outputs

### Basics {#Basics_3_1_1}

With omics data from step 1 and outcome data uploaded, upon clicking the ***Refresh plot*** button, the risk associations between outcomes and 2 selected components (selected from step 1) are co-visualized. The figure can be downloaded by clicking ***Download figure***.

# **Step4:** Mediation analysis and visualization

::: columns
::: column
After the first 3 steps, We go beyond from exposure-Omics-outcome co-visualization to mediation analysis. You can click "Triplot with mediation" in step 4 at the side bar. <br> This step will calculate mediation analysis results, using selected exposures and outcomes. Principal components are seen and used as mediators. Confounders from step 2 are also automatically adjusted for exposure-mediator and mediator-outcome associations respectively in this step. (1) The mediation results (i.e. direct, indirect and total effect) or the proportion mediated are then co-visualized with (2) the correlation coefficients of the selected exposures and (3) the risk associationsâ€™ estimates as beta coefficients or odds ratio of the selected outcomes as 3 different layers in one 2-dimensional plot.

Three boxes will show up. Two are "Main settings for data analysis and visualization" and "Other visualization settings" (See figure). The other is the visualization output.

::: callout-note
The first three steps , with more flexible options in analysis and visualization settings, aim to help user to explore data and results. After some tryouts in step 1-3, users should form ideas on what they want to include in their final analysis and figures (e.g. perform confounder adjustment or not; present risks estimates as beta-coefficient or odds ratio). We then recommend users to ***Reset everything*** in step 1 and re-perform step 1-3 to get a cleaner version of steps (e.g. Do not upload auxilary data or covariate if you will not use them) before entering step 4.

## Main settings

### Basics

1.  ***Component/module on first/second axis***: The principal component that will be plotted on the x/y-axis. The default is *1/2* (the first/second one).

2.  ***What kind of mediation analysis do you want to do*** Two options are provided, *Traditional* and *Counterfactual*. By selecting *Traditional*, mediation analysis based on the [product method](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-publhealth-032315-021402) will be performed. By selecting *Counterfactual* mediation analysis, a potential outcome framework provided by the [*mediation* package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mediation/vignettes/mediation.pdf) is used. Here is a summarizarion of these 2 methods in TriplotGUI.

![](img/step4_2.png)

### Emerged

1.  ***Exposure variables***: This button will show up upon exposure data is uploaded in step 2. Users can choose which exposures they want to include in their mediation analysis.

2.  ***Outcome variables***: This button will show up upon outcome data is uploaded in step 2. Users can choose which exposures they want to include in their mediation analysis.

3.  ***Treatment/control for exposures*** When the mediation method is selected as *Counterfactual*, this button will show up upon exposure data is uploaded in step 2 and exposures for mediation analysis are selected. For each selected exposure variables, users needs to specify two values (for continous exposures) or two classes (for categorical exposures) as treatment and control, respectively

### Running mediation analysis

***Click when add new variables/ run with different methods***:

After the users select the exposures and outcomes that they want to perform mediation analysis on, unlike previous steps that automatically performs analysis upon uploading data, the users need to click the ***Do mediation*** button to start running mediation analysis, due to the time mediation analysis may take. (Mediation analysis will be performed on the each combination of exposure, principal component and outcome).

Upon clicking, the button will turn grey. A progress bar will then show up at the right bottom corner to remind users if mediation analysis is still running (since it may take sometime). After running mediation analysis, the progress bar will disappear and the button itself will change back to white color.

::: callout-note
-   The interface memorizes what mediation analysis has been run (e.g. Using what exposure, what outcome, what method). This means that once you have run mediation analysis on certain exposures and outcomes, even if you unselect an exposure or outcome, their mediation result are not deleted. You can check this by reselecting the unselected exposure/outcome and click ***Do mediation***. You may notice that the mediation analysis is finished rather fast since the result is already there.
-   You can run *Counterfactual* and *Traditional* analysis alternatively on the same exposure-outcome pair. The result for different methods will be saved respectively.
-   For a *Counterfactual* mediation analysis, if you have used exposures-outcomes pairs to run mediation analysis, given specific treatment or control values for exposures, once you use a different treatment or control values for an exposure, all the mediation analysis connecting with that exposure will be rerun and the new results will replaces the corresponding old ones.
-   *Counterfactual* mediation analysis may take more time to run *Traditional* mediation analysis.
:::

::: callout-important
-   By selecting exposures, outcomes and specifying mediation method and then clicking ***Do mediation***, the mediation analysis will be run and the results will be saved for the selected exposures, outcomes and mediation methods.
-   Visualization will be based on what is selected in the **Main settings** and set up in the **other settings**. And the visualization will only show the results (using specific exposures, outcomes and mediation methods) that are saved.

## Other visualization settings {#simple_code_link}

1.  ***Making triplot with mediation result***: The figure will only be further generated when this option is *Yes*. Upon selecting *Yes*, all other visualization settings will show up. The default is *No*.

2.  ***Plot medaitions/correlations/risks***: Whether mediations, correlations and risk estimates will be plotted on the visualization. The default is *Yes*. Upon selecting a *No*, buttons that are relevant to plot mediations/correlations/risks will not show up.

3.  ***Mediation/correlation/risk Labels*** Whether the labels of mediations, correlations and risk estimates will be plotted on the visualization. The default is *Yes* for mediaiton, correlation and risk labels

4.  ***Mediation/correlation/risk Limits*** The limits of mediations, correlations and risk estimates on the visualization. The default value is set as the same value in step 3 for correlation and risk Limits. The default value for mediation limits is set as 1.1 times of the maximum value for mediation results' confidence intervals.

5.  ***Whisker length for mediations/risks***: The whisker length of confidence intervals in the figure. Change it from 0.1 to 0.5 and see what is changed in Visualizations! The default is 0.1.

6.  ***Mediation proportion or estimate***: Two options are provided, *Proportion* and *Estimate*. Upon selecting *Proportion*, the proportion mediated (The impact of indirect effect among the total effect) will be used as mediation result for visualization. Upon selecting *Estimate*, the mediation estimates (indirect, direct and total effect) will be used as mediation result for visualization. The default is *Proportion*

7.  ***plot indirect, direct and total effect***: Upon selecting *Estimate*, this checkbox option will show up, providing three choices: *IE* (indirect effect), *DE* (direct effect), *TE* (total effect). Users can chose more than one choices to be visulized on the mediation triplot.

8.  ***Plot which proportion***: Upon selecting *Proportion*, this checkbox option will show up, providing two choices: *IE/(IE+DE)* and *IE/(abs(IE)+abs(DE))Ã—(IE+DE)/(abs(IE+DE))*.

    The former represents the conventional way of calculating proportion mediated, without considering the situation when the direct and indirect effect goes into opposite directions. This may lead to a proportion bigger than 1.

    The latter method represents a novel way to calulate proportion mediated. The formula use the absolute value of direct and indirect effect to calculate total effect, which limits the proportion mediated to be within 0-1. The *IE* and *(IE+DE)/(abs(IE+DE))* term in the formula counted in the directionality of indirect and total effect after calulation is perfomed. Users can chose more than one choices to be visulized on the mediation triplot.

9.  ***log(risk estimate)***: Users can choose whether they want their risk estimates to be presented as beta coefficients or odds ratios. Two options are provided, *Yes* and *No* . By selecting *Yes*, odds ratio will be used. By selecting *No*, beta coefficient will be used. The default is *No*

The [green box]{style="color:green"} represents visualization outputs. With omics data from step 1 and exposure and outcome data from step 2 uploaded and mediation analysis performed, upon clicking the ***Refresh plot*** button, the selected exposures' correlations, selected outcomes risk associations' and mediation analysis estimates are co-visualized. The figure can be downloaded by clicking ***Download mediation triplot***.

## Mediation barplots

We also provide mediation barplots in Step 4, which focus on visualizing the mediation estimates and directions through barplot, using one exposure, one mediator(principal component) and one outcome. The barplot visualization for traditional and counterfactual mediation analysis are separated. ![](img/step4_4.png)

### Visualization settings

The [orange box]{style="color:orange"} represents visualization settings. After mediation analyses are run, ***Exposure/Mediator/Outcome*** variables that are involved in the mediation analyses will show up in the options for visualization settings. Users can choose one exposure, one mediator and one outcome to make the barplot. ![](img/step4_3.png)

### Traditional/Counterfactual mediation barplot

The [green box]{style="color:green"} represents visualization outputs. Upon clicking the ***Refresh plot*** button, the mediation barplot for the selected exposure, mediator and outcome is shown. The figure can be downloaded by clicking ***Download traditonal/counterfactual mediaiton barplot***.

# **Step5:** Compare correlations, associations and mediations:

Through heatmaps, (1) the exposures' correlations with principal components, (2) the outcomes' associations with principal components and (3) mediation estimates and proportion mediated for each principal component and exposure-outcome pair, as well as their significance levels can be visualized.

1.  ***Which PCs you want to remove***: All the selected principal components from step 1 will show up as rows in the heatmap. Users can decide which principal components they want to remove from the heatmap visualizations here.

2.  ***Do you want correlation coefficients/risk estimates/mediation estimates to be shown***: The users can decide what heatmap they want to be shown. The default is *Yes* for all options.

3.  ***Which correlation/risks you want to move***: All the selected exposures and outcomes from step 2 will show up as columns in the heatmap. Users can decide which exposures and outcomes they want to remove from all the heatmap visualizations here.

4.  ***Which type of mediation estimates to be shown***: For the mediation heatmap, users can choose what mediation result (direct effect, indirect effect, total effect, two types of proportion mediated) they want to show.

## Visualizations

The [green box]{style="color:green"} represents visualization outputs. Upon clicking the ***Refresh plot*** button, the heatmaps for correlations (between selected exposures and principal components), risk associations (between selected outcomes and principal components) and mediations (based on the selected exposures, outcomes, principal components and step 4's completed mediation analysis results) are shown. The figure can be downloaded by clicking ***Download figure***.

# **Step6:** Download data

This step provides convenience to help user to download data and intermediate results produced in data analysis and visualization. ![](img/step6_1.png)

## Download processed data

In the The [darkblue box]{style="color:darkblue"}, users can download processed data in csv format. The processed data of Omics, exposures and outcomes, i.e. data after possible variable removal and class change mentioned in [1.1.2](#Emerged_1_1_2) and [1.2.2](#Emerged_1_2_2), can be viewed and downloaded here.

If auxilary data or covariate data are uploaded in step 1 and 2, they processed version can be similarly viewed and downloaded here.

Separately, the selected exposures, outcomes and principal components as mediator variables that are used in the mediation analysis in step 4 can be viewed and downloaded here.

## Download exposures's correlations, outcomes' associations and mediation results

From the [lightblue box]{style="color:lightblue"}, results from correlations, associations and mediation can be viewed and download here.

1.  ***Correlation matrix*** are correlation coefficients between exposures and principal components generated from step 2.

    ***p values of correlations*** are p values of correlations between exposures and principal components generated from step 2.

2.  ***Risk estimates*** are beta coefficients between the outcome-principal component association generated from step 2. If users want to use odds ratios, they just simply need to calculate the exponential of the data.

    ***p values of risks*** are p values of risk estimates between outcomes and principal components generated from step 2.

3.  ***mediation estimates*** are direct effect, indirect effect and total effect for each combination of exposure, principal component as mediator and outcome generated from step 4.

    ***p values of mediation estimates*** are p values of direct effect, indirect effect and total effect for each combination of exposure, principal component as mediator and outcome generated from step 4.

4.  ***proportion mediated*** are two types of proportions ( *IE/(IE+DE)*, *IE/(abs(IE)+abs(DE))Ã—(IE+DE)/(abs(IE+DE))* )for each combination of exposure, principal component as mediator and outcome calculated from step 4.

    ***p values of proportion mediated*** are the p values of *IE/(IE+DE)* for each combination of exposure, principal component as mediator and outcome calculated from step

## TPObject

In the [red box]{style="color:red"}, users can download TPObjects from step 1-4 in rda format. We refer the list that we use to save information and pass them through the steps as TPObject. From step 1, a TPObject is generated, intermediate output and result from each step are added into this TPObject. This aim to facilitate advanced R users to used the information (e.g. intermediate output and results) to perform further analysis and interpretation.

Note that 2 TPObject can be generated from step 2, seprately, one only use information from exposures and omics, the other only use information form outcomes and omics. The information can be integrated into one TPObject from step 3.

If you are interested, please check out the [Tutorial(simple)](simple_code.qmd), [Tutorial(complex)](complex_code.qmd), [Use Case](use_case.qmd). to explore what is contained in the TPObject from each step!
