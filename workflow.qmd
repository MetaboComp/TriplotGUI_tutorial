We will go through the statistical analysis behind [TriplotGUI]{style="color:orange"} and also explain the rationale of our visulaization in each step. If you want to search the meaning of something specific (e.g. a button, a box), please press `ctrl+F` and enter the keyword, you will probably find what you need.

If you have not open the app yet, follow what is written in the [Setup](installation.qmd){style="color:blue"} and open the interface with `TriplotGUI_shiny()`

::: {.alert .alert-primary}
**Note:** You can use the [example data](https://gitlab.com/YingxiaoYan/triplotgui/-/tree/main/Example_data?ref_type=heads){target="_blank"} in our repository to follow the details in steps, so that you get hands-on replication of the steps
:::

# **Step1:** Data reduction of Omics data

After reading the introduction (step 0), you can click step 1 at the side bar and you will see the lay out as below. ![](img/step1_1.png)

<br> As mentioned in the introduction, this step is to transform the Omics data into a number of components using principal component analysis (PCA) or weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA).

Five boxes with unique features are presented. You can more or less guess what they are for from there titles. Now we go through each boxes in details

## Data for PCA/WGCNA

### Basics {#Basics_1_1_1}

The [dark blue box]{style="color:darkblue"} is where you put in the Omics data. The data should meet the following criteria.

-   The data should be in either csv, xlsx, rds, or rda format. The data in rds format should be a dataframe. If the data is in rda format, the rda object should only contain the data as a dataframe and be in the same directory as your working directory (You could check this by `getwd()` in the R console)
-   The rows of data should represent observations and the columns of data should represents variables(omics features).
-   No missing values are allowed in the data
-   The number and order of observations should be same across all the uploaded data

::: callout-note
We do not provide the functionality of handling missing data or other data pre-processing steps (e.g. transformation, normalization) in our application due to the variability of possible methods.
:::

### Emerged {#Emerged_1_1_2}

After you upload the data, A text will show up to tell you how many rows and columns do you have in the data frame. Three following buttons also emerge: ***Inspect variable class, remove variables, Force all variables to numeric***.

1.  ***Inspect variable class*** This is a button that help you inspect if the variables are in correct format, since you may not want your metabolite features in character format when you want to use their numeric values. Click the button and explore.

2.  ***remove variables***: This button allows you to remove variables from your uploaded data. Click the button, remove some variables and click OK. What variables are removed are then printed out and they will not be included in the Omics data to enter the downstream analysis. We also make this removal reversible so that every time when you reclick this button, the data will go back to the state where no variables are removed.

    We add this button so that users will not need to manually remove redundant variables that will actually not be used in data analysis.

3.  ***Force all variables to numeric***: Upon clicking, this button simply forces all the variables to numeric. Since we want to perform PCA or WGCNA on this Omics data, we want all Omics variables to be in numeric format

### And more

At the right side of the upload data, there is a button called ***Reset everything***. This where you can click remove all your uploads and settings and make the interface go back to a default state.

## Auxilary data {#auxilary_data}

The [light blue box]{style="color:lightblue"} is where you put in the auxilary data. Currently, the variables in the data uploaded here can be used for 2 things (1) Customizing the color, size and shape of scores. See section [1.4.2](#Emerged_1_4_2). (2) Providing pairing information for outcomes' associations. See section [1.1.1](#Basics_1_1_1).

### Basics {#Basics_1_2_1}

The requirement for input data is the same as [1.1.1](#Basics_1_1_1).

### Emerged {#Emerged_1_2_2}

After you upload the axuliary data, A text will show up to tell you how many rows and columns do you have in the data frame. Three following buttons also emerge: ***Inspect variable class, remove variables, Change variable class***.

1.  ***Inspect variable class*** Same as [1.1.2](#Emerged_1_1_2)

2.  ***remove variables***: Same as [1.1.2](#Emerged_1_1_2)

3.  ***Change variable class***: This button provide your choices in transforming variables to either factor and numeric variables.

    We add this button to faciliate user in tranforming variables to numeric and factor format, corresponding to numeric and caregorical variables.

## Data analysis settings

The [red box]{style="color:red"} is where you make choices in how do you want your data analysis to be performed

### Basics

1.  ***Method***: Users choose to either use principal component analysis (*PCA*) or weighted correlation network analysis (*WGCNA*) to perform data reduction. The default is *PCA*

2.  ***PCA function***: Users choose what PCA function, [*prcomp*](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/prcomp){target="_blank"} or [*principal*](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/psych/versions/2.4.1/topics/principal){target="_blank"}, will be used for principal component analysis. The default is *prcomp*

3.  ***Max number of components***: This button shows up when the ***Method*** is *PCA*. It decides how many principal component will be used in the downstream correlation& association analysis. The default is set as around the half of the total number of omics variables used for analysis.

    ***Minimum number for variables per module***: This button shows up when the ***Method*** is *WGCNA*. It decides the minimum number of variables that is allowed in each cluster of WGCNA. The default number is *2*.

4.  ***Center***: If the omics variables will be zero centered before the analysis take place. The default is *Yes*.

5.  ***Scale***: If the omics variables will be scaled to have unit variance before the analysis take place. The default is *Yes*.

### Emerged

1.  ***rotate***: The button will show up and When ***PCA function*** is chosen as *principal*. How users would like to transform principal components. Please check [*here*](https://search.r-project.org/CRAN/refmans/psych/html/fa.html){target="_blank"} for the explanation fo rotate. The default is set as *none* in TriplotGUI.

::: callout-note
You maybe heard about PCA but not **WGCNA**. In brief, WGCNA is to separate omics variables into clusters, perform PCA on each cluster and extract the first principal component of each cluster as the principal components of WGCNA. The clustering method can be different. In TriplotGUI, we use the default hierarchical clustering method provided by `cutreeDynamic()` in the *dunamicTreeCut* package
:::

## Visualization settings

The [orange box]{style="color:orange"} is where users can modify their visulization outputs

### Basics

# **Step3:** Visualization of Triplot

The component scores and loadings, the correlation coefficients and the risk associationsâ€™ estimates as beta coefficients or odds ratio, are co-visualized as 3 different layers in one 2-dimensional plot.

# **Step4:** Mediation analysis and visualization

Performs mediation analysis on the selected exposures and outcomes, using component scores as mediators. Mediation analysis can be done in traditional and counterfactual approaches. Confounders can be adjusted for exposure-mediator and mediator-outcome association respectively. The mediation estimates (i.e. direct, indirect and total effect) or the proportion mediated are then visualized with the correlation coefficients of the selected exposures and the risk associationsâ€™ estimates as beta coefficients or odds ratio of the selected outcomes as 3 different layers in one 2-dimensional plot.

# **Step5:** Compare correlations, associations and mediations:

The correlations, associations, mediation estimates and proportion mediated as well as their significance levels can be visualized through heatmap.

# **Step6:** Download data

The intermediate data and the generated results can be viewed and downloaded. The object that saves all relevant information can be downloaded.
