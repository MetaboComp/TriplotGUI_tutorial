### Background

Most observational epidemiology research studies associations between single exposure and outcome. Emerging exposure- and outcome-wide studies aim to more broadly identify potential risk factors and their health effects. Although omics technologies have permitted linking exposures to outcomes via molecular data, large-scale exploration of mediating mechanisms is frequently lacking. Likely because Omics data are often high dimensional and there is a lack of effective tools for direct interpretation of complex relationships between multiple exposures, Omics and outcomes. We therefore developed the TriplotGUI tool to advance exposome-risk assessment and facilitate the interpretation of such complex associations via metabolic regulation.
