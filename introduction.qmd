# Overview

**Background&aim:** Emerging exposure- and outcome-wide studies aim to more broadly identify potential risk factors and their health effects. Although Omics technologies have permitted linking exposome to outcomes, large-scale exploration of mediating mechanisms is frequently lacking. Likely because Omics data is often high dimensional and there is a lack of effective tools for direct interpretation of complex relationships between exposures, Omics and outcomes. We therefore developed the [TriplotGUI]{style="color:black"} tool to advance exposure-risk assessment and facilitate the interpretation of such complex associations via Omics profile.

**Methods:** Omics variables-of-interest are reduced to components using principal component analysis (PCA) or weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) and are associated with both exposures and outcomes using linear models. Components are then investigated as potential mediators using “meet-in-the-middle” analysis, i.e. intersecting exposure-Omics and Omics-outcome associations, and mediation analysis. TriplotGUI supports both classical (Baron-Kenny) and counterfactual mediation, as well as adjustment for covariates.

**Results:** As a molecular epidemiology toolbox, among its various functionalities, TriplotGUI co-visualizes Omics variable contributions, exposure-Omics and Omics-outcome associations as well as direct and indirect effects from mediation analysis. Centering the analyses around molecular data allows for simultaneous assessment of multiple exposures and outcomes. Without the need of programming, users can conveniently perform analysis and visualization at a [web version of TriplotGUI](https://yingxiao.shinyapps.io/triplotgui/){target="_blank"}. TriplotGUI can also be installed conveniently as a stand-alone application in RStudio in secure environments and is therefore suited for GDPR. Please read the [Setup](installation.qmd){target="_blank" style="color:blue"} session for more about installation.

**Conclusion:** Using synthetic and real-world data with dietary variables as exposures, we showed that TriplotGUI can comprehensively analyze, visualize and interpret associations between exposures and outcomes through metabolome. Its flexible user interface facilitates the integration of exposures, Omics and outcomes to untangle their complex relationships.

# Steps

The TriplotGUI application adopted a highly reactive stepwise modular design, where one or two modules represents one of the 6 following steps and the change of input from an early step will feed into a later step.

**Step1:** Data reduction of omics data

Transforms the Omics data into a number of components using principal component analysis (PCA) or weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA).

**Step2A:** Exposures' correlations

Assesses correlations between exposures and component scores from Step 1. Confounders can be adjusted.

**Step2B:** Outcomes' associations

Assesses risk associations between outcomes and the component scores from Step 1. Confounders can be adjusted.

**Step3:** Visualization of Triplot

The component scores and loadings, the correlation coefficients and the risk associations’ estimates as beta coefficients or odds ratio, are co-visualized as 3 different layers in one 2-dimensional plot.

**Step4A:** Mediation analysis and visualization

Performs mediation analysis on the selected exposures and outcomes, using component scores as mediators. The mediation estimates (i.e. indirect and total effect) or the proportion mediated are then co-visualized with the component loadings, the correlation coefficients of the selected exposures and the risk associations’ estimates as beta coefficients or odds ratio of the selected outcomes, as different layers in one 2-dimensional plot.

**Step4B:** Visualization for single mediations

A clear overview of the magnitude and direction of indirect, direct and total effect of each single mediation analysis can be visualized through bar plots.

**Step5:** Compare correlations, associations and mediations

The correlations, associations, mediation estimates and proportion mediated as well as their significance levels can be visualized through heatmaps.

**Step6:** Download data

The intermediate data and the generated results can be viewed and downloaded. The object that saves all relevant information can be downloaded.
