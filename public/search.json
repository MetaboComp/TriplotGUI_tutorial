I will give a talk about reliable amortized Bayesian inference with neural networks and co-lead a workshop on amortized Bayesian workflows.\nDecember 2023: We launched the BayesFlow Forums! The BayesFlow Forums provide a community for asking and answering questions about all aspects of BayesFlow and amortized Bayesian workflows in general. Hop over and join the discussion!\nOctober 11, 2023: In our recent preprint, we make simulation-based inference more data-efficient by leveraging self-consistency properties of the Bayesian joint model. You find the preprint on arXiv. Update: Published in the NeurIPS UniReps workshop.\nSeptember 22, 2023: Our paper “Detecting Model Misspecification in Amortized Bayesian Inference with Neural Networks” has been awarded the DAGM GCPR Honorable Mention at this year’s German Conference on Pattern Recognition. Huge thanks to my great co-authors!\nSeptember 6, 2023: Our paper “Detecting Model Misspecification in Amortized Bayesian Inference with Neural Networks” has been accepted with oral presentation at the German Conference for Pattern Recognition 2023. Learn more at the project website.\nJune 21, 2023: I will be at the ELLIS Doctoral Symposium 2023 in Helsinki from August 28 to September 1, 2023. Absolutely thrilled to meet other PhD students and researchers and talk about machine learning research in beautiful Helsinki!\nMay 9, 2023: Our paper “JANA: Jointly Amortized Neural Approximation of Complex Bayesian Models” has been accepted to UAI 2023 (Uncertainty in AI). Check out the project page to find out more!\nMarch 29, 2023: I’ll be presenting our paper on Meta-Uncertainty in Bayesian Model Comparison at AISTATS 2023 from April 25-27 in Valencia, Spain. You find links to the paper and code on my Projects page or on the dedicated paper website. If you see me around at AISTATS, let’s chat!"
