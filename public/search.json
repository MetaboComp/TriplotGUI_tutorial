    "text": "Background\nMost observational epidemiology research studies associations between single exposure and outcome. Emerging exposure- and outcome-wide studies aim to more broadly identify potential risk factors and their health effects. Although omics technologies have permitted linking exposures to outcomes via molecular data, large-scale exploration of mediating mechanisms is frequently lacking. Likely because Omics data are often high dimensional and there is a lack of effective tools for direct interpretation of complex relationships between multiple exposures, Omics and outcomes. We therefore developed the TriplotGUI tool to advance exposome-risk assessment and facilitate the interpretation of such complex associations via metabolic regulation.\nStep1: PCA/WGCNA plot Step2: Exposures’ correlations Step2: Outcomes’ associations Step3: Triplot Step4: Triplot with mediation Step4: Mediations Step5: Check and compare Step6: Download data\nTo get started, upload your dataset and navigate through the dashboard’s steps to access the different functionalities.

In a nutshell, we invert Bayes’ theorem and estimate the marginal likelihood based on approximate representations of the joint model. Upon perfect approximation, the marginal likelihood is constant across all parameter values by definition. However, approximation error leads to undesirable variance in the marginal likelihood estimates across different parameter values. We formulate violations of this symmetry as a loss function to accelerate the learning dynamics of conditional neural density estimators."
