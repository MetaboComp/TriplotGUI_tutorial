Below is a heatmap of all my recorded activities made using leaflet. It’s challenging to see individual markers at my most frequented trail heads/starting points, so I’ve recently began building out my own Strava Dashboard (using {shinydashboard}) to make it a bit more interactive and filterable – it’s a work in progress, but a fun side project that I’m excited to continue iterating upon.

At some point, I learned to embrace the weird and it became very much a part of my everyday identity. My track coaches and teammates would shout “LET’S GO CSIK” during my events at meets, I signed year books as “Sam [drawing of a chick]” and every handmade card received my “The Csik Press” identifying mark on the back. As I’ve grown older, I’ve taken more care to help colleagues, peers, and strangers learn the correct pronunciation – because if I’m being totally honest, I think my name is pretty darn cool Face Smile Wink\n. So my first ever real logo is an homage to my earliest attempts at claiming my Csik identity. It may evolve a bit, but for now, it makes me pretty happy. Made using the (free!)

In a nutshell, we invert Bayes’ theorem and estimate the marginal likelihood based on approximate representations of the joint model. Upon perfect approximation, the marginal likelihood is constant across all parameter values by definition. However, approximation error leads to undesirable variance in the marginal likelihood estimates across different parameter values. We formulate violations of this symmetry as a loss function to accelerate the learning dynamics of conditional neural density estimators."

    "text": "6 News\n\nJanuary 23, 2024: I will be at Bayes on the Beach 2024 in February. I will give a talk about reliable amortized Bayesian inference with neural networks and co-lead a workshop on amortized Bayesian workflows.\nDecember 2023: We launched the BayesFlow Forums! The BayesFlow Forums provide a community for asking and answering questions about all aspects of BayesFlow and amortized Bayesian workflows in general. Hop over and join the discussion!\nOctober 11, 2023: In our recent preprint, we make simulation-based inference more data-efficient by leveraging self-consistency properties of the Bayesian joint model. You find the preprint on arXiv. Update: Published in the NeurIPS UniReps workshop.\nSeptember 22, 2023: Our paper “Detecting Model Misspecification in Amortized Bayesian Inference with Neural Networks” has been awarded the DAGM GCPR Honorable Mention at this year’s German Conference on Pattern Recognition. Huge thanks to my great co-authors!\nSeptember 6, 2023: Our paper “Detecting Model Misspecification in Amortized Bayesian Inference with Neural Networks” has been accepted with oral presentation at the German Conference for Pattern Recognition 2023. Learn more at the project website.\nJune 21, 2023: I will be at the ELLIS Doctoral Symposium 2023 in Helsinki from August 28 to September 1, 2023. Absolutely thrilled to meet other PhD students and researchers and talk about machine learning research in beautiful Helsinki!\nMay 9, 2023: Our paper “JANA: Jointly Amortized Neural Approximation of Complex Bayesian Models” has been accepted to UAI 2023 (Uncertainty in AI). Check out the project page to find out more!\nMarch 29, 2023: I’ll be presenting our paper on Meta-Uncertainty in Bayesian Model Comparison at AISTATS 2023 from April 25-27 in Valencia, Spain. You find links to the paper and code on my Projects page or on the dedicated paper website. If you see me around at AISTATS, let’s chat!"
