:::

### Introduction

This section offers a concise overview of the research background, methodology, results, and conclusions, as well as the design principles behind TriplotGUI.

### Setup

Here, users will find step-by-step instructions for installing TriplotGUI as a standalone application in RStudio and activating its graphical user interface.

### Manual

The manual section provides comprehensive guidance for using TriplotGUI. Users can follow detailed explanations to customize their analyses and visualizations. This section focuses on functionality rather than interpretation of results.

### Tutorial(simple)

This section presents a basic example of using TriplotGUI, utilizing the CAMP_2 dataset. It offers two approaches: 

- Code tutorial: Suitable for users with beginner-level R skills 
- User interface tutorial: Ideal for those with limited epidemiology knowledge and experience in handling high-dimensional data

### Tutorial(complex)

A more advanced example using the HealthyNordicDiet_2 dataset, with two options: 

- Code tutorial: Tailored for intermediate to advanced R users 
- User interface tutorial: Designed for users with epidemiology knowledge and experience in working with high-dimensional data

<!-- ### Use Case -->

<!-- This section shows a smoother example of how to use the interface to perform data analysis and interpretation, omiting the detailed explanation in the tutorial. -->

<!-- The dataset used is ExposomeChallenge. -->

### Paper

This section showcases relevant papers related to TriplotGUI and includes a previous poster of TriplotGUI.
