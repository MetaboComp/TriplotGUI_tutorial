### Introduction

This section covers a brief introduction of our research background, method, result and conclusion, as well as the design of TriplotGUI.

### Setup

This section gives instructions on how to install TriploGUI as a stand-alone application in RStudio and how to activate its graphical user interface in RStudio

### Manual

This sections presents a detailed manual for using TriplotGUI. Users can follow the clarifications in this section to customize their own analysis and visualization. We will not focus on the produced visualization output and interpretation here. Such content will be covered by the Tutorial section.

### Tutorial(simple)

This section provides a simple example of how to use the TriplotGUI package. The users can either use code or the user interface to achieve the similar purpose. The code tutorial suits for users that is at beginner R level. The user interface tutorial suits for user that has limited epidemiology knowledge and limited experience in dealing with high dimensional data.

The dataset used is CAMP_2

### Tutorial(complex)

This section provides a more complex example of how to use the TriplotGUI package. The users can either use code or the user interface to achieve the similar purpose. The code tutorial suits for users that is at intermediate or advanced R level. The user interface tutorial suits for user that has epidemiology knowledge and experience in dealing with high dimensional data.

The dataset used is HealthyNordicDiet_2.

<!-- ### Use Case -->

<!-- This section shows a smoother example of how to use the interface to perform data analysis and interpretation, omiting the detailed explanation in the tutorial. -->

<!-- The dataset used is ExposomeChallenge. -->

### Paper
