The **`<iframe>`** element in HTML (Inline Frame) is used to embed another HTML document within the current document. It allows you to display content from another source, such as a different webpage, in a specified rectangular area on your page.

`<iframe src="https://www.example.com" width="600" height="400" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>`

Here's a common use case for **`height: 0;`** along with other properties:

The CSS property **`overflow: hidden;`** is used to control how content that overflows the content area of an element should be handled. When applied to an element, it hides any content that exceeds the specified dimensions of the element's box.
