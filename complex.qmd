# Data description

Each dataset used in this page of tutorial can be downloaded [here](https://gitlab.com/YingxiaoYan/triplotgui/-/blob/main/Example_data){target="_blank"} as a dataframe in the rds/rda/csv/xlsx files:

-   Example2_exposure.rda
-   Example2_Omics.rds
-   Example2_outcome.rds
-   Example2_covariate.csv
-   Example2_auxiliary.xlsx

We have used different file types on purpose to show you that TriplotGUI can deal with different data type.

The data used in this page of tutorial can be downloaded [here](https://gitlab.com/YingxiaoYan/triplotgui/-/blob/main/data/HealthyNordicDiet_2.rda){target="_blank"} in rda format.

The Data used for this example originates from ***HealthyNordicDiet_2***, modified from the **HealthyNordicDiet** data provided by the triplot package (Schillemans et al. 2019). **HealthyNordicDiet** is a synthetic dataset that was simulated from the authentic data used in a case/control study nested within the Swedish prospective Västerbotten Intervention Programme cohort. The original study was set up to explore plasma metabolites that could objectively reflect healthy Nordic dietary patterns in a matched case-control study and to assess associations between such patterns and later development of type 2 diabetes. (Shi et al. 2018). We have selected our exposures, Omics data, outcomes, covariates and auxiliary data based on the ***HealthyNordicDiet_2*** data following the code [here](https://gitlab.com/YingxiaoYan/triplotgui/-/blob/main/Tutorial_code/Data_cleaning_HealthyNordicDiet_2.R){target="_blank"}. The brief description of these data is shown as below.

-   Example2_exposure.rda: containing a dataframe with 17 variables representing the dietary intake as measured by food frequency questionnaires (`"HFI"`(Healthy Food Index),`"BSDS"`(the Baltic Sea Diet Score), `"Wholegrains"`, `"Sausage"`, `"Pizza"`, `"Refined.bread"`, `"Fruits"`, `"Liquor"`, `"Wine"`, `"Hamburger"`, `"Poultry"`, `"Fish"`, `"Margarine"`, `"Cabbage"`, `"Carrot"`, `"low_fat_Dairy"`, `"Vegetables"`). HFI is a categorical factor variable with 7 levels (0-6). All the other variables are continuous/numeric.
-   Example2_Omics.rds: 31 variables representing plasma metabolites predictive of BMI. All 31 variables are continuous/numeric.
-   Example2_outcome.rds: 3 variables:
    -   `"BMI"`: A continuous variable.
    -   `"BMI_cat"`: A categorical factor variable with 4 levels: normal, overweight, obese, underweight
    -   `"T2D"`: A binary factor variable, 1 for cases and 0 for controls.
-   Example2_covariate.csv: 5 variables that can be used as potential confounders: 
    -   `"Gender"`: A factor variable with 2 levels: 1, 2.
    -   `"Age"`: A continuous/numeric variable.
    -   `"Education"`: A factor variable with 4 levels: 1-4.
    -   `"PhysicalActivityIndex"`: A factor variable with 4 levels: 1-4.
    -   `"Smoking"`:  A factor variable with 45 levels: 1-5.
-   Example2_auxiliary.xlsx: 2 variables that can be used as potential confounders: 
    -   `"PairedInfo"`: A factor variable containing the pairing information of case-control pairs of `"T2D"`, with 500 levels: 1-500
    -   `"Energy"`: A continuous/numeric variable.
    -   `"FastingGlucose"`: A continuous/numeric variable.
    -   `"Education"`: A factor variable with 4 levels: 1-4.
    -   `"PhysicalActivityIndex"`: A factor variable with 4 levels: 1-4.

All data are row-wise matched by observation and consist of 1000 synthetic observations.

# Research question

We want to assess the relationship between diet, metabolic profiles and Type 2 diabetes and BMI. We assume that metabolites serves as mediators, mediating the effect of dietary exposures on Type 2 diabetes and BMI outcome.

# The use of interface

Run `TriplotGUI_shiny()` to open your interface. What we will show as an example in the interface here correspond to the [Code example of using TriplotGUI](https://yingxiaoyan.gitlab.io/triplotgui_tutorial/complex_code.html#step-2){target="_blank"} section in this page.

## Step 1: Data reduction of Omics data and auxiliary data

First upload the Omics data and auxiliary data in step 1. Upon finish uploading the Omics data, a series buttons will also show up in case you need to to make some modification on the Omics or auxiliary data. Inspect the classes of variables briefly. You would see it looks okay for Omics data's class but not auxiliary data. Some categorical variables should be in factor format rather than character. Therefore we change their classes.

::: columns

:::

::: {.column style="width: 5%"}
:::

::: {.column style="width: 45%"}
![](img/complex_1_2.png)
:::
:::

Then change the "Data analysis settings" and "Visualization settings" as figure. In this example, we will use WGCNA method to obtain the principal components and using auxiliary data to obtain more informative figures.

We could then examine the scree plot, score plot, loadings plot and biplot at step 1.

::: columns
::: {.column style="width: 45%"}
![](img/complex_1_3.png) ![](img/complex_1_4.png) You can then play around the visualization panel on the right side and view all the plots (score, loadings, biplot, screeplot).

## Step 2: Exposures’ correlations & Outcomes’ associations

Then upload exposures and covariate data in step 2A. By briefly inspecting variable classes, you could notice: - In the exposure data, `"HFI"`(Healthy Food Index) is a factor variable while `"BSDS"` (Baltic Sea Food Index) is a numeric variable. We may not need to change their classes at this point, but it is good to be aware of this to get a better understanding what happens in the downstream steps - A variable called `"X"` exists in the covariate data. This is because the covariate data is uploaded as a csv file and the observation number may automatically be generated as a new variable when the file is read in. Remove this variable since it is not an actual covariate.

::: callout-note
Note that an rda file needs to be in the same directory as where you opened the TriplotGUI app.
:::

Change your "Data analysis settings" as the figure below.

::: callout-note
-   Select *One-hot-encoding* in ***Categorical variables*** performs one-hot-encoding to transform categorical exposures variables (i.e. `HFI`) with n\>2 classes to n binary variables. If *Use Original* is specified in ***Categorical variables***, then the `HFI` variable is forced to be a numeric variable. This is not recommended unless you are sure that the level itself reflects the numeric value.
-   The approaches for managing ***Missing values*** are inherited from the *cor* package for continuous exposures. Please check [*cor*](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/cor.html){target="_blank"} package for more information.

:::
:::

Then in step 2B, upload outcome and covariate data By briefly inspecting variable classes, you could notice: - In the outcome data, `"BMI"` is a numeric variable; `"BMI_cat"` and `"T2D"` are factor variables. - A variable called `"X"` exists in the covariate data. This is because the covariate data is uploaded as a csv file and the observation number may automatically be generated as a new variable when the file is read in. Remove this variable since it is not an actual covariate.

Change your "Data analysis settings" and "Visulization settings" as the figure below.

::: callout-note
Some clarification for using multinomial regression and pairing variables:

-   When a pairing variable is not provided:
    -   Not performing multinomial regression means that one-hot-encoding will be performed to transform outcome's categorical variables with n \> 2 classes to n binary variables. And logistic regression will be performed on the binary variables and linear regression will be performed on continuous variables.
    -   Performing multinomial regression means that multinomial regression will be performed on outcome's categorical outcome variable with n \> 2 classes, which gives n-1 estimates. And logistic regression will be performed on the binary variables and linear regression will be performed on continuous variables.
-   When a pairing variable is provided:
    -   Not performing multinomial regression means that one-hot-encoding will be performed on outcome's categorical variables with n \> 2 classes. And then conditional logistic regression will be performed on the binary variables and linear mixed model will be performed on continuous variables, using the pairing information.
    -   Performing multinomial regression means that the pairing information will not be ignored and used (since the outcomes can have more than 2 classes), multinomial regression will be performed on outcome's categorical variable, which gives n-1 estimates. And logistic regression will be performed on the binary variables and linear regression will be performed on continuous variables. THIS IS THE CASE IN OUR EXAMPLE.

## Step 3: Visualization of Triplot

In step 3, by clicking "Refresh plot", you can see and download the triplot that co-visualizing the three plots shown above. The left side panel gives you freedom of making adjustment to the plot. ![](img/complex_3_1.png)

In the triplot, blue circle points represent exposure correlations and the red square points represents outcome risk estimates with confidence interval. So what information can we get from this figure? Lets us list a few points:

-   Having a brief look, the generally healthy food (e.g. `"Fruits"`, `"Vegetables"`) is on the first dimension of the figure and the generally unhealthy food (e.g. `"Hamburger"`, `"Sausage"`, `"Margarine"`) is on the third dimension of the figure. The numeric outcome `"BMI"`, binary outcome `"T2D"`, and one-hot-encoded categorical `"BMI_cat"` outcome is on the second and fourth dimension of the figure.
-   Explanation on some variables in the plot:
    -   `"HFI"` stands for healthy food index. A higher `"HFI"` suggests healthier diet. `"HFI"` ranges from 0 to 6. You can see that there are *HFI_0*, *HFI_1*...*HFI_6* in the figure and that is because `"HFI"` is used as a factor exposure variable in step 2 and is one-hot-encoded (´allowcategorical=F´) to the same number of binary variables as its number of levels. For example, *HFI_6* is a binary variable where individuals with `"HFI 6"` (most healthy diet people) will be labeled as 1 and the rest of individuals will be labelled as 0. *HFI_0* is a binary variable where individuals with `"HFI 6"` (most unhealthy diet people) will be labeled as 1 and the rest of individuals will be labelled as 0. *HFI_1*...*HFI_5* has limited use since it only separates the group of people with certain `"HFI"` from to the rest, which is a mixture of healthier and less healthier diet people.
    -   `"BSDS"` stands for Baltic Sea Diet Score ranging. A higher `"BSDS"` suggests healthier diet. `"BSDS"` is used as a numeric variable ranging from 2 to 25 in this step.
    -   *BMI_cat_obese*, *BMI_cat_overweight*,*BMI_cat_underweight* are the odds ratio generated from the multinomial regression. Since `"BMI_cat"` is a categorical outcome and multinomial regression is performed in step 2 (`multinomial=T`), normal weight is uses as a reference and odds ratio of obese, overweight and underweight is produced. (Note that the first level of the factor variable is set as the default reference, in this case it is *normal*.
-  Adjusting for `"Age"`, `"Gender"`, `"Smoking"`, `"Education"` and `"FastingGlucose"`, component from the first cluster (on x-axis) correlates positively with generally healthy food (e.g. `"fruits"`, `"vegatables"`) and food index (e.g. `"BSDS"`) and negatively with unhealthy food (e.g. `"Hamburger"`, `"pizza"`). It also reversely associated with `"T2D"` and `"BMI"`. From the result from `"BMI_cat"`, this components also reversely associated with being obese. 
-  Component from the second cluster (on y-axis) associated positively with generally healthy food (e.g. `"fruits"`, `"vegatables"`) and food index (e.g. `"BSDS"`) and negatively with unhealthy food (e.g. `"Hamburger"`, `"pizza"`). However, the component correlates also positively with `"T2D"`,`"BMI"`, *obese*, *overweight* and negatively associated with *underweight*. 
-  Based on what we summarized above, the two components may be associated with a overall healthy eating pattern. And in such pattern, the first component is associated more with the beneficial effect on health and the second component represents the adverse health effect that may be caused by this pattern.

There are many things you could explore further in the following mediation analysis. To narrow down our focus and clearly show our examples, we select `"BSDS"` (Baltic Sea Diet Score) and `"Hamburger"` as our exposures, `"BMI"` and `"T2D"` as outcome to enter our next step.

## Step 4: Mediation analysis and visualization

This time, we perform the mediation analysis using the conterfactual/potential outcome method (the ´mediation´ package) on the our exposures (i.e. `"BSDS"`, `"Hamburger"`), mediators (i.e. the first PC of the first 2 clusters) and outcome (i.e. `"T2D"`, `"BMI"`) of interest, adjusting for `"Age"`, `"Gender"`, `"Smoking"`, `"Education"` and `"FastingGlucose"` for both exposure-mediator and mediator-outcome relationship.

::: callout-note
In the counterfactual mediation analysis, you need to specify contrast values of treatment and controls for each exposure. In brief, the algorithm will compare the scenarios with these 2 exposure values/levels. For my detailed explanation please refer to [this paper](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i05){target="_blank"} of the `mediation` R package.

If an exposure variable is continuous (numeric variable), it is recommended that the 2 exposure values is chosen between the range of the exposure variable. If an exposure variable is categorical (factor variable), the 2 exposure levels should be chosen from the levels of the exposure variable.
:::

::: columns
::: {.column style="width: 40%"}
Use the following settings for your data analysis. Mediation analysis is then performed using the counterfactual method on the our selected exposures, mediators and our selected outcomes, adjusting for covariates for both exposure-mediator and mediator-outcome relationship.

::: callout-note
-   Note that you need to click ***Do mediation*** to start running the mediation analysis.

You could then play around in the "Visualization settings" too see how you want to visualize your plot.
:::

::: columns
::: {.column style="width: 40%"}
You could first only show the proportion mediated(PM) and adjust the limits to make the points more visible. 

![](img/complex_4_2.png)
:::

::: {.column style="width: 5%"}
:::

::: {.column style="width: 45%"}

![](img/complex_4_3.png) 

In the figure, we could see the direction and magnitude of proportion mediated for the 2 mediators, all the exposures and outcomes. Note that in the figure we have observed significant proportion mediated for BSDS-component 1-BMI and BSDS-component 2-BMI mediations

:::
:::

::: callout-note
-   Note that some confidence intervals are automatically removed form the figure if they are not within the limit.
-   Note that for some mediations, direct effect and indirect effects are in the opposite direction, implying possibly proportion mediated\>1, since total effect could smaller than indirect effect.
:::



::: columns
::: {.column style="width: 40%"}
You then show the adjusted proportion mediated (APM) and adding the layers of correlation and risk estimates 

![](img/complex_4_4.png)

:::

::: {.column style="width: 5%"}
:::

::: {.column style="width: 45%"}
![](img/complex_4_5.png)
:::
:::

By observing this figure, we could see the direction and magnitude of adjusted proportion mediated for the 2 mediators, all the exposures and outcomes. The position of the points is similar what we have seen for proportion mediated. Note that APM for BSDS as exposure and T2D as outcome is smaller than their PM. This is because the indirect and direct effect for this mediation is of similar size but in opposite direction. This leads to a smaller total effect and in turn larger PM, but APM will not be affected by the directionality of direct and indirect effect.

::: callout-note
-   No confidence interval is shown for adjusted proportion mediated, as such value can not be directly calculated from the mediation analysis.

-   Note that even direct effect and indirect effects are in the opposite direction, adjusted proportion mediated is always smaller than 1, since it uses the sum of the absolute value of indirect and direct effect as denominator. $$APM=\frac{IE}{|IE|+|DE|}\cdot\frac{|IE+DE|}{IE+DE}=\frac{IE}{IE+DE}\cdot\frac{|IE+DE|}{|IE|+|DE|}=\frac{IE}{IE+DE}\cdot\frac{|IE|+|DE|}{|IE+DE|}$$
:::

In step 4, you can also see the barplots showed direct, indirect and total effect for each exposure-mediator-outcome combination. It is a convenient tool to check the direction and magnitude of mediation estimates.

![](img/complex_4_6.png)

Base on the barplot and the triplot with mediation, we have observed significant proportion mediated for BSDS-component1/2-BMI mediations. Further exploration on indirect, direct and total effect of the mediation analysis could be explored in the interface. We will not go into details here.

## Step 5: Compare correlations, associations and mediations

Users can then check the heatmaps of correlations, risk estimations and mediation results at step 5. By removing other PCs, exposures or outcomes in the "Visualization settings", users may only show correlation, risk estimation and mediation results of their interest.

Relevant data, intermediate results, can then be viewed and downloaded at step 6.
