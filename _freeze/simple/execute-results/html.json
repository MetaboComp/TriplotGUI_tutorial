We have selected our exposures, Omics data, outcomes and covariates based on the ***CAMP_2*** data following the code [here](https://gitlab.com/YingxiaoYan/triplotgui/-/blob/main/Tutorial_code/Data_cleaning_CAMP_2.R){target=\"_blank\"}. The brief description of these dataframes is shown as below.\n\n-   Example1_exposure.rds: 11 variables representing the dietary intake as measured by food frequency questionnaires (`\"Refined_grains\"`, `\"Coarse_grains\"`, `\"Red_meat\"`, `\"Poutry\"`, `\"Seafood\"`, `\"Egg\"`, `\"Animal_organs\"`, `\"Vegetables\"`, `\"Fruits\"`, `\"Potatos\"`, `\"Legumes\"`)\n-   Example1_Omics.rds: 20 variables representing plasma metabolites predictive of BMI\n-   Example1_outcome.rds: 5 variables representing clinical measurements: `\"BMI\"`, `\"HDL\"`(high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), `\"LDL\"`(low-density lipoprotein cholesterol), `\"triglycerides\"`, `\"total_cholesterol\"`.\n-   Example1_covariate.rds: 2 variables that can be used as potential confounders: `\"AGE\"` and `\"SEX\"`\n\nAll dataframes are row-wise matched by observation and consist of 300 synthetic observations.\n\n**Reference**\n\nLiu X, Liao X, Gan W, et al.

[doi: 10.3390/metabo9070133](https://www.mdpi.com/2218-1989/9/7/133){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n\n# Research question\n\nWe want to assess the relationship between diet, metabolic profiles and risk factors of metabolic diseases (i.e. BMI, total cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL, LDL). We assume that metabolites serves as mediators, mediating the effect of dietary exposures on BMI outcome.\n\n# The use of interface\n\nRun `TriplotGUI_shiny()` to open your interface. What we will show as an example in the interface here correspond to the [Code example of using TriplotGUI](https://yingxiaoyan.gitlab.io/triplotgui_tutorial/simple_code.html#step-2){target=\"_blank\"} section in this page\n\n## Step 1: Data reduction of omics data\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column style=\"width: 45%\"}\nFirst upload the Omics data in step 1 and then examine the scree plot, score plot, loadings plot and biplot at step 1. ![](img/simple_1.png)\n\nUpon finish uploading the Omics data, a series buttons will also show up in case you need to to make some modification on the Omics data.\n\n![](img/simple_1_1.png)\n\nYou can then play around the visualization panel on the right side and view all the plots (score, loadings, biplot, screeplot).\n:::\n\n::: {.column style=\"width: 5%\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.column style=\"width: 40%\"}\n![](img/simple_1_2.png)\n\n:::\n:::\n\n## Step 2: Exposures’ correlations & Outcomes’ associations\n\nThen upload exposures, outcomes and covariates data in step 2.\n\n![](img/simple_2.png)\n\nYou could briefly see the correlation coefficients and risk estimates at step 2 respectively in visualizations by clicking \"Refresh plot\".\n\n![](img/simple_2_1.png)\n\n## Step 3: Visualization of Triplot\n\nIn step 3, by clicking \"Refresh plot\", you can see and download the triplot that co-visualizing the three plots shown above. The left side panel gives you freedom of making adjustment to the plot. ![](img/simple_3.png)\n\nIn the triplot, PC1 reflected metabolites that were positively associated with BMI and also correlated with a high intake of meat and refined grains, adjusting for age and sex. This implies that the metabolite features that contributes most to PC1, are likely to provide useful information for a potential mechanism of how red meat and refrained grains intake may affect BMI.\n\n## Step 4: Mediation analysis and visualization\n\n\n::: columns\n\n::: {.column style=\"width: 40%\"}\n![](img/simple_4.png)\n:::\n\n::: {.column style=\"width: 5%\"}\n:::\n\n\n::: {.column style=\"width: 45%\"}\nUse the following settings for your data analysis. Mediation analysis is then performed using the Baron-Kenny conventional \"product\" method on the our exposures (i.e. Refined grains, Red meat), mediator (i.e. PC1, PC2) and outcome (i.e. BMI) of interest, adjusting for age and sex for both exposure-mediator and mediator-outcome relationship.\n\n::: callout-note\n-   Note that you need to click ***Do mediation*** to start running the mediation analysis.\n-   In the default setting, only proportion mediated is visualized. You could go to the \"Visualization setting\" to select ***Mediation estimate or proportion*** as *Estimate* to show the indirect effect or total effect triplot with mediation.\n:::\n\n\n![](img/simple_4_1.png)\n:::\n\n\n\n:::\n\nIn step 4, you can also see the barplots showed direct, indirect and total effect for each exposure-mediator-outcome combination. It is a convenient tool to check the direction and magnitude of mediation estimates.\n\n![](img/simple_4_2.png) \n\nBased on the barplot and the triplot with mediation, we observed a significant mediation effect through PC1 for Red_meat-BMI and refined_grain-BMI association. This further implies that the metabolite features that contributes to PC1 are likely to mediate the pathway from red meat and refined grain intake to BMI change.\n\n## Step 5: Compare correlations, associations and mediations\n\nUsers can then check the heatmaps of correlations, risk estimations and mediation results at step 5. By removing other PCs in the \"Visualization settings\", users may only show results relvant to PC1 and PC2.\n\n![](img/simple_5.png)\n\n\n![](img/simple_5_1.png)\n\n## Step 6: Download data\n\nRelevant data, intermediate results, can then be viewed and downloaded at step 6.\n\n![](img/simple_6.png)\n",
