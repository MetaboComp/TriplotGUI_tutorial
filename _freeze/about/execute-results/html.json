I am also a co-organizer of [R-Ladies Santa Barbara](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-santa-barbara/), a local data science group which works to promote gender diversity in the R community.\n\nMy background is in marine ecology / ecophysiology -- I was afforded opportunities to study coral disease in Panama and the Florida Keys as an undergrad, then temperature effects on spiny lobster metabolism and foraging behavior in Santa Barbara for my Masters degree. Since the beginning of my time in STEM, I was totally terrified of all things data / coding / data science, but thanks to a super supportive community and some really rad colleagues / instructors, I found my new path in data science education and I absolutely *love* it.\n\n::: column-margin\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/formal.jpg){fig-alt='A classroom full of students face forward towards the instructor, who stands at a podium at the front of the room. Students have their laptops open on their desks. Three large TV screens are illuminated at the front of the classroom, displaying workshop materials.' width=410}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.extra-small-text .dark-gray-text .topbr}\nTeaching MEDS students how to build their own personal websites using Quarto! This was especially fun for me, since Quarto was still such a new tool when I first gave this workshop -- it meant a lot of discovery and learning on-the-fly alongside our students.\n:::\n:::\n\nI'm afforded a lot of flexibility in how I teach and what I teach. My focus is on developing and delivering workshop-style classes that supplement the [MEDS core curriculum](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/courses.html). I teach primarily via live-coding (where my computer is hooked up to a screen for workshop participants to see and hear me talk through code in real time as they follow along on their own computers) -- this teaching style was invaluable in my own development as a data scientist, and I really believe that, when done well, live-coding can be a game-changing experience for early-career coders and data scientists. I am always looking for new ways to make my teaching style and materials more approachable and inclusive for all learners -- I try to build my materials to be stand-alone resources both for participants to refer back to and also for those learning on their own time. Feel free to check out / reuse / recycle any of my [workshop](talks_workshops.qmd) and [course](courses.qmd) materials.\n\n## {{< fa industry title=\"A person with a backpack and trekking \" >}} Work outside academics\n\n## {{< fa people-group title=\"A person with a backpack and trekking pol\" >}} Leadership\n\n## {{< fa seedling title=\"A person with a backpack and trekking pole\" >}} Self development\n\nI feel very fortunate to be doing so many of things that I love *a lot* right now. That includes my job, but also spending lots of time outdoors. Living in Santa Barbara is a massive privilege and being here means that we have access to both the mountains and the sea, each a few minutes in either direction. It was the ocean that brought me here originally, but most of my free time is now spent on the trails.\n\n::: column-margin\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/formal.jpg){fig-alt='A smiling woman with braiding pigtails, a blue bandana tied around her neck, and a blue hiking backback takes a selfie with a brown dog.

Below is a heatmap of all my recorded activities made using [`leaflet`](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/). It's challenging to see individual markers at my most frequented trail heads/starting points, so I've recently began building out my own Strava Dashboard (using [`{shinydashboard}`](https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/)) to make it a bit more interactive and filterable -- it's a work in progress, but a fun side project that I'm excited to continue iterating upon. Huge shout out to [Daniel Cullen](https://www.dancullen.me/) (who also happens to be a Santa Barbara resident!) for his awesome [blog post](https://www.dancullen.me/articles/creating-a-heatmap-in-r-with-google-polylines) that got me started with my own map.\n\n::: {.gray-italic .center-text}\nMap last updated: December 27, 2023\n:::\n\n<p class=\"large-text quote-text-bg center-text\">\n\n{{< fa arrow-pointer >}} For a more interactive experience, click around my [Strava dashboard](https://samanthacsik.shinyapps.io/strava_dashboard/) <br> {{< fa brands github >}} Source code available on [GitHub](https://github.com/samanthacsik/strava-dashboard)\n\n</p>\n\n<!-- NOTE: large space between last line of text and bottom of gray background when using quarto syntax, so sticking with HTML syntax above -->\n\n## {{< fa person-running title=\"An egg\" >}} {{< fa person-rifle title=\"An egg\" >}} {{< fa bullseye title=\"An egg\" >}} Hobbies\n\nI'm a proud Csik (pronounced \"chick\" -- Hungarian, for the curious), though I spent many of my younger years embarrassed when people (understandably) got it wrong (variations include \"sea-sick,\" \"sick,\" \"ca-sick,\" to name a few) -- and many of us know how brutal little kid peers can be when there's a funny way to mispronounce a name. At some point, I learned to embrace the weird and it became very much a part of my everyday identity. My track coaches and teammates would shout \"LET'S GO CSIK\" during my events at meets, I signed year books as \"Sam \\[drawing of a chick\\]\" and every handmade card received my \"The Csik Press\" identifying mark on the back. As I've grown older, I've taken more care to help colleagues, peers, and strangers learn the correct pronunciation -- because if I'm being totally honest, I think my name is pretty darn cool `<svg aria-label=\"Face Smile Wink\" role=\"img\" viewBox=\"0 0 512 512\" style=\"height:1em;width:1em;vertical-align:-0.125em;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;font-size:inherit;fill:#64605F;overflow:visible;position:relative;\"><title>Face Smile Wink</title><path d=\"M464 256A208 208 0 1 0 48 256a208 208 0 1 0 416 0zM0 256a256 256 0 1 1 512 0A256 256 0 1 1 0 256zm177.6 62.1C192.8 334.5 218.8 352 256 352s63.2-17.5 78.4-33.9c9-9.7 24.2-10.4 33.9-1.4s10.4 24.2 1.4 33.9c-22 23.8-60 49.4-113.6 49.4s-91.7-25.5-113.6-49.4c-9-9.7-8.4-24.9 1.4-33.9s24.9-8.4 33.9 1.4zM144.4 208a32 32 0 1 1 64 0 32 32 0 1 1 -64 0zm165.8 21.7c-7.6 8.1-20.2 8.5-28.3 .9s-8.5-20.2-.9-28.3c14.5-15.5 35.2-22.3 54.6-22.3s40.1 6.8 54.6 22.3c7.6 8.1 7.1 20.7-.9 28.3s-20.7 7.1-28.3-.9c-5.5-5.8-14.8-9.7-25.4-9.7s-19.9 3.8-25.4 9.7z\"/></svg>`{=html}.
